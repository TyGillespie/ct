# ct

A script to get the compile time of something (not initially by me).

## Notes.

This script was not initially by me. I don't know who made it initially, I just found it online. I will continue to make updates to it as I see fit.

## Building

### GCC/MinGW

```batch
gcc ct.c -s -o ct.exe
```
